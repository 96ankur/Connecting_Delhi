yaar image display ni ho rhi

uska component file khol
backend ka code dikha

uploads folder kaha hai 
ok ruk

ruk yaar me dekh ta hoon 

backend pe multer laga, usse file upload hogi,. modify angular code to send file separate from multipart data
then you will have the url , and you are getting the url in the template as well, 
and and and

add 
express.statis('/uploads', __dirname + 'uploads);
to app.js
